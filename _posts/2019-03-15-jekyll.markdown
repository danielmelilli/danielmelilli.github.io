I have been looking around for a new project and I have had my eye on Jekyll for the longest time.

For those that arent familiar, Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby. Instead of using
databases, it takes the content, renders Markdown or Textile and Liquid templates and produces
a complete, static website ready to be served.

It's actually the engine behind GitHub Pages, which is where this site is being hosted.  
You can find my github link below and see all the source code for this site! 

Although it was fairly easy to configure, I felt it could have been explained a little better so I'll 
post up my steps at some point.

Editing content is fairly straightforward.  My next project is to be able to fully maintain and manage
the content on this site using my iPhone and iPad. Let me know if you have any recommendations for a 
GitHub client for iOS.
